This was supposed to be an extra credit assignment for AP Computer Science.

I got bored, so I have completed this in many different languages.

I hope I get the extra credit :)

Explanation:

This is a triangle:

```

0:
1:      *
2:     * *
3:    * * *
4:   * * * *
5:  * * * * *
6: * * * * * *
...

```

Counting to the first row, there is only one dot.
Counting to the second row, there are three dots.
And so on.

The task is to take the height of a triangle, 
and return how many dots are in it.

This is then expanded to a pyramid, with the same principle.
